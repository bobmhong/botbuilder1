# Thank You Bot

Thank You Bot is based on the Microsoft Bot Framework and uses Microsoft LUIS service for natural language understanding.

For more information on the framework, see: 

Bot Builder for Node.js
[Bot Builder for Node.js](http://docs.botframework.com/builder/node/overview/) is a powerful framework for constructing bots that can handle both freeform interactions and more guided ones where the possibilities are explicitly shown to the user. It is easy to use and models frameworks like Express & Restify to provide developers with a familiar way to write Bots.
